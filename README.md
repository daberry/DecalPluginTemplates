# DecalPluginTemplate

## SamplePlugin-VVS
* Requires that the client have both Decal and VVS (Virindi View System) installed.

## Important developer notes
* If you add this plugin to decal and then also create another plugin off of this sample, you will need to change the GUID in
 Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs to have both plugins in decal at the same time.
* In fact, if you use these templates, you should create a unique GUID anyway in
 Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs.
